Overview This project aims to detect diabetic retinopathy, a condition causing blindness, by applying deep learning techniques. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution retinal images, the ResNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is employed along with computer vision libraries to analyze and predict the presence of this eye condition.

Technologies Used Python Matplotlib Scikit-learn NumPy Pandas ResNet CNN Dataset The dataset comprises 9GB of high-resolution retinal images collected under various imaging conditions. This diverse dataset ensures robustness and accuracy in the model's predictive capabilities.

Methodology Data Preprocessing: Standardization and augmentation of retinal images to prepare the dataset for effective model training. Model Training: Utilization of the ResNet CNN model, fine-tuned for the specific requirements of retinal image analysis. Performance Evaluation: Rigorous testing of the model against a subset of the dataset to evaluate accuracy and reliability. Key Features Automated Analysis System: An advanced system capable of assigning a severity score on a scale of 0-4, where 0 indicates no diabetic retinopathy and 4 signifies severe condition. High Accuracy Detection: Leveraging deep learning for precise and reliable detection of early signs of diabetic retinopathy.
